excerpt: "So you decided to learn C/C++ and wrote your first hello world program but don’t know how to run it?"

There are a lot of steps involved in converting your `helloWorld.cpp` to `helloWorld.exe`. The following are the stages through which our program passes before being transformed into an executable form:

# Compiling a C/C++ program

To compile a program on macOS we will use [clang](https://clang.llvm.org) which is the default compiler for macOS. On linux we’ll be using [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) .

This basic syntax to compile a c file is as follows:

```shell
# on linux
> gcc -o <output_file> source_file.c

# on macOS
> clang -o <output_file> source_file.c
```

<Alert color="info">
  To compile a c++ file instead of a c file just replace gcc with g++ and clang
  with clang++.
</Alert>

## Example

Lets say we have the following C++ program in a file `helloworld.cpp`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

To compile this file open a terminal and `cd` into the directory where the current file is located. Now run the following command.

```shell
g++ -o helloworld helloworld.cpp
```

This will compile (i.e preprocess, compile, assemble and link) our file and the name of the output executable file will be `helloworld` (without extension).

Now run the executable:

```shell
> ./helloworld
Hello World!
```
